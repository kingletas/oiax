By the end of this, somebody who has never seen oiax should have it doing
something real.

## What this is

Say in one sentence what this is.

Say what problem that solves, in the reader's own terms, before any mechanics.

## Step 1: install it

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kingletas/oiax && cd oiax && make check
```

`make check` runs the linter and the tests against a local API server, and touches no cluster. Don't run `make install` yet: it installs the CRD into whatever cluster your current kubeconfig points at. A `make demo` that builds its own `kind` cluster is on the way.

## Step 2: point it at something

What does it need to be told before it can do anything? Name the one setting
that matters most, and what happens when it is missing.

## Step 3: run it

Show real output, copied from a real run. If a healthy run says nothing, say so
plainly — that surprises people.

## What you get for free

The things a reader would otherwise build themselves, and did not have to.
